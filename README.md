# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call. The bug is in the `bug.js` file.  The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Bug Description

The application fetches data from a remote API. The fetch operation completes successfully, but the FlatList remains blank.  Console logs show no errors.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring data is properly formatted for the FlatList component and handles potential edge cases such as empty data sets. The solution is implemented in `bugSolution.js`

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app (using a React Native environment).
4. Observe that the FlatList does not display the fetched data.
5. Examine `bugSolution.js` for the fix.
